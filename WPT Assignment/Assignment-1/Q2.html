                    <p><b> <br> Rishi Raj Kapoor (04 September 1952 – 30 April 2020) was an Indian actor, film director and film producer who worked in Hindi films.
                            He was the recipient of several accolades, including winning four Filmfare Awards and a National Film Award.
                    </b></p>

                    <p><b>  Born into the Kapoor family, he made his debut, as an adolescent, in his father Raj Kapoor's film Mera Naam Joker (1970), for which he won the National Film Award for Best Child Artist.
                            As an adult, his first lead role was opposite Dimple Kapadia in the teen romance Bobby (1973), which won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Between 1973 and 2000, Kapoor starred as the romantic lead in 92 films.
                            Some of his notable films during this period include Khel Khel Mein (1975), Kabhi Kabhie (1976), Sargam (1979), Karz (1980), and Chandni (1989).
                    </b></p>

                    <p><b>  Since the 2000s, Kapoor played character roles to critical acclaim in such films as Luck by Chance (2009), Love Aaj Kal (2009), Do Dooni Chaar (2010), Agneepath (2012), 102 Not Out (2018) and Mulk (2018).
                            For his performance in Do Dooni Chaar (2010), he won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor, and for his role in Kapoor & Sons (2016), he won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.
                            He was honoured with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. His final film appearance was in the suspense thriller The Body (2019).
                            Around the age of three, Kapoor's first on-screen appearance was a cameo in his father Raj Kapoor's film Shree 420 (1955), where he would appear in the musical sequence of "Pyar Hua, Iqrar Hua Hai".
                            Likewise, Raj Kapoor would direct the film that provided Rishi his debut role, the 1970 film Mera Naam Joker, in which the actor would portray the young version of the lead character (played by Raj Kapoor).
                            Kapoor married actress Neetu Singh, who he had worked with in several films, in 1980.
                            The couple had two children— son, actor Ranbir Kapoor, and daughter, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni.
                            Kapoor's autobiography Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored, was released on 15 January 2017.
